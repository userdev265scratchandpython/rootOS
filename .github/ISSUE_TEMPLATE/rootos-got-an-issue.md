the python script keeps doing something unexpected?
please describe what happens(ex : it caused a bsod, stops responding, had a module error[...])

the batch script seems to not install any module?
does the install-modules.bat stays open?

software incompatibility?
does the rootos subsystem have any issue with an external program?
